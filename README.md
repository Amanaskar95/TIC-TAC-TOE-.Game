Imagine you and a friend are playing Tic-Tac-Toe on a piece of paper. In this Java program, the game is played between two players, and the computer helps you manage the game.

##  Player Class (Player.java):
Each player has a name (like "Player 1" or "Player 2") and a symbol they use (either X or O).
When you create a player, you give them a name and a symbol.

## Board Class (Board.java):
The game board is like a grid on your piece of paper.
It's a 3x3 grid where you can place Xs and Os.
The board keeps track of where the Xs and Os are placed and checks if someone has won or if the game is a draw.

## TicTacToe Class (TicTacToe.java):
This is like the game manager.
It starts the game, sets up the players, and manages the game flow.
It asks players to take turns, places their symbols on the board, and checks if someone has won or if it's a draw.

## Main Method:
This is where the game starts.
It creates the game manager and begins the game.
